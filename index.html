                Mérida has a rich Maya civilization history that predates the arrival of the Spanish by centuries. The city was built on the site of the ancient Maya city of T’hó, one of the oldest, continually-occupied cities in the Americas.

            <p>
                In 1542, Spanish conquerors founded and named the city Mérida after a Spanish city. In the early years, the Spanish established convents throughout the city to replace the indigenous culture with Christianity. By the end of the 16th century, much of the Maya culture and many of the Maya people were destroyed.

                Mérida has one of the largest historic districts in the Americas. Only Mexico City and Havana, Cuba have larger historical centers. The city is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people – many of them expats – are restoring the old colonial buildings in the center of the city.

                Today, Mérida is a thriving city of over 1 million people. It is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucatán Peninsula and often hosts international events. About 60 percent of Mérida’s population is of Maya heritage. The city also has many residents of Spanish, French and British ethnicity, making it one of the most ethnically diverse large cities in Mexico.
